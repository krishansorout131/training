**  What is Rails?

    An extremely productive web-application framework.

    Written in Ruby by David Heinemeier Hansson.

    You could develop a web application at least ten times faster with Rails than you could with a typical Java framework.

    An open source Ruby framework for developing database-backed web applications.

    Configure your code with Database Schema.

    No compilation phase required.

*** install rails:--
gem install rails

*** checking version 
rails -v

*** creating first project :--

rails new demo -d postgresql

*** conect to database postgresql :-- Make some changes under config/database.yml file

-> Add our user name like postgres 
-> Add our password for postgres
   
* create database :-- 
 for creating database for the project we need to run :-
 rails db:create    command on terminal in root directory of project : beryl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/demo$
 
 ** drop database :--
 rails db:drop
 
beryl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/myapp$ rake db:drop
Dropped database 'myapp_development'
Database 'myapp_test' does not exist
 
                                                    
*** starting serever :--
rails server

after this to see your app type localhost address and see your app :-

http://localhost:3000                                                    


--------------------------------

** Ruby on Rails MVC Framework

The Model View Controller principle divides the work of an application into three separate but closely cooperative subsystems.

* Model (ActiveRecord )

It maintains the relationship between the objects and the database and handles validation, association, transactions, and more.

This subsystem is implemented in ActiveRecord library, which provides an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records. Ruby method names are automatically generated from the field names of database tables.


* View ( ActionView )

It is a presentation of data in a particular format, triggered by a controller's decision to present the data. They are script-based template systems like JSP, ASP, PHP, and very easy to integrate with AJAX technology.

This subsystem is implemented in ActionView library, which is an Embedded Ruby (ERb) based system for defining presentation templates for data presentation. Every Web connection to a Rails application results in the displaying of a view.


* Controller ( ActionController )

The facility within the application that directs traffic, on the one hand, querying the models for specific data, and on the other hand, organizing that data (searching, sorting, messaging it) into a form that fits the needs of a given view.

This subsystem is implemented in ActionController, which is a data broker sitting between ActiveRecord (the database interface) and ActionView (the presentation engine).


                                                 -------------------------------------------------

* Workflow for Creating Rails Applications

    Use the rails command to create the basic skeleton of the application.

    Create a database on the PostgreSQL server to hold your data.

    Configure the application to know where your database is located and the login credentials for it.

    Create Rails Active Records (Models), because they are the business objects you'll be working with in your controllers.

    Generate Migrations that simplify the creating and maintaining of database tables and columns.

    Write Controller Code to put a life in your application.

    Create Views to present your data through User Interface.


**** Rails Active Record is the Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) layer supplied with Rails. It closely follows the standard ORM model, which is as follows âˆ’

    tables map to classes,
    rows map to objects and
    columns map to object attributes.

Rails Active Records provide an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records. Ruby method names are automatically generated from the field names of database tables.
