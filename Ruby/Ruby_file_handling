                                            --------------> Ruby - File I/O  <---------------
                                            

*** Ruby provides a whole set of I/O-related methods implemented in the Kernel module. All the I/O methods are derived from the class IO.

The class IO provides all the basic methods, such as read, write, gets, puts, readline, getc, and printf.                                            

** The puts Statement:--

The puts statement instructs the program to display the value stored in the variable. This will add a new line at the end of each line it writes.

examples := 
name = "krishan"
puts name

output:-- 
krishan
beryl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/RubyPractical$ 


** The gets Statement:--

The gets statement can be used to take any input from the user from standard screen called STDIN.

puts "Please enter your name"
name = gets
puts name

output: --

Please enter your name       : here it takes input from user and give output
jai singh
jai singh


** The putc Statement

Unlike the puts statement, which outputs the entire string onto the screen, the putc statement can be used to output one character at a time.
Example:-- 

puts "Please enter your name"
name = gets
putc name

output:-- 
Please enter your name
jai
j

** The print Statement

The print statement is similar to the puts statement. The only difference is that the puts statement goes to the next line after printing the contents, whereas with the print statement the cursor is positioned on the same line.

examples:-- 

name = "Bhagat singh"
print name
output:--

Bhagat singhberyl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/RubyPractical$
