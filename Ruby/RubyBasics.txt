                                                      =====> Ruby Basics <====


-> Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language. Ruby is considered similar to Perl and Smalltalk programming languages. It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX.

-> It is fully object oriented programming language. Everything is an object in Ruby. Each and every code has their properties and actions. Here properties refer to variables and actions refer to methods.

-> Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment). It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.


* Let us write a simple program in ruby. All ruby files will have extension .rb So, put the following source code in a test.rb file.

  puts "Hello Rubby i am krishan sorout"
output:--
beryl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/RubyPractical$ ruby test.rb
Hello ruby i am krishan sorout 

* Whitespace in Ruby Program

Whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs are generally ignored in Ruby code, except when they appear in strings. Sometimes, however, they are used to interpret ambiguous statements. Interpretations of this sort produce warnings when the -w option is enabled.
Example:-

a + b is interpreted as a+b ( Here a is a local variable)
a  +b is interpreted as a(+b) ( Here a is a method call)
  
 ** Line Endings in Ruby Program

Ruby interprets semicolons and newline characters as the ending of a statement. However, if Ruby encounters operators, such as +, −, or backslash at the end of a line, they indicate the continuation of a statement.

** Ruby Identifiers

Identifiers are names of variables, constants, and methods. Ruby identifiers are case sensitive. It means Ram and RAM are two different identifiers in Ruby.

Ruby identifier names may consist of alphanumeric characters and the underscore character ( _ ).

** Here Document in Ruby

"Here Document" refers to build strings from multiple lines. Following a << you can specify a string or an identifier to terminate the string literal, and all lines following the current line up to the terminator are the value of the string.

If the terminator is quoted, the type of quotes determines the type of the line-oriented string literal. Notice there must be no space between << and the terminator.

Here are different examples −


print <<EOF
   This is the first way of creating
   here document ie. multiple line string.
EOF

print <<"EOF";                # same as above
   This is the second way of creating
   here document ie. multiple line string.
EOF

print <<`EOC`                 # execute commands
	echo hi there
	echo lo there
EOC

print <<"foo", <<"bar"  # you can stack them
	I said foo.
foo
	I said bar.
bar

** Ruby BEGIN Statement
Syntax:-
puts "This line is not printed first"
BEGIN {
puts "this line always print first"
}

output:-- beryl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/RubyPractical$ ruby test.rb
this line always print first
This line is not printed first

** Ruby end statement:- 

END {
    puts "this line always printed in last"
}

puts "This line is not printed first"
BEGIN {
puts "this line always print first"
}

output:--
this line always print first
This line is not printed first
this line always printed in last

* Ruby Comments
-> multiple line comments

=begin
 this is a comment
 hii this is another way
 of multiple line comments
=end
-> single line comment in statement

puts "This line is not printed first"
BEGIN {
puts "this line always print first" # this is a comment
}
-> Another way of multiple line comment:-
# this is a comment
# this is a comment


**** Ruby - Classes and Objects:--

An object-oriented program involves classes and objects. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles.

** Defining a Class in Ruby:-

A class in Ruby always starts with the keyword class followed by the name of the class. The name should always be in initial capitals. The class Customer can be displayed as −

class Customer
end

You terminate a class by using the keyword end. All the data members in the class are between the class definition and the end keyword.

** Creating Objects in Ruby using new Method:-

cust1 = Customer. new
cust2 = Customer. new

**Custom Method to Create Ruby Objects:--

class Customer
   @@no_of_customers = 0
   def initialize(id, name, addr)
      @cust_id = id
      @cust_name = name
      @cust_addr = addr
   end
end

cust1 = Customer.new("1", "John", "Wisdom Apartments, Ludhiya")
cust2 = Customer.new("2", "Poul", "New Empire road, Khandala")

** variables:- 

* Global variable :-
Global variables begin with $. Uninitialized global variables have the value nil and produce warnings with the -w option.

$globalvar=10
$var2=100
class Test 
    def check
        puts "global variable in class 1 is #$globalvar"
    end
end
obj1=Test.new
obj1.check        
class Test1
    def check1
        puts "this is second claas and global variable is #$var2"
    end
end
obj2=Test1.new
obj2.check1        

output:--
beryl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/RubyPractical$ ruby test.rb
global variable in class 1 is 10
this is second claas and global variable is 100

* Ruby Instance Variables:-
Instance variables begin with @. Uninitialized instance variables have the value nil and produce warnings with the -w option.

class Test 
    def initialize(id,name,addr)
        @id=id
        @name=name
        @addr=addr

    end 
    def details()
        puts "The id is #@id"
        puts "Name is #@name"
        puts "And the address is #@addr" 
    end
end

obj1=Test.new("1","krishan","hodal")
obj2=Test.new("2","mohit","palwal")
obj1.details()
obj2.details()

output:--
beryl@beryl-HP-ProBook-6460b:~/Desktop/RubyPractical$ ruby test.rb
The id is 1
Name is krishan
And the address is hodal
The id is 2
Name is mohit
And the address is palwal
