    rvm list known          # list available interpreters
    rvm install <version>   # install ruby interpreter
    rvm use <version>       # switch to specified ruby interpreter
    rvm remove <version>    # remove ruby interpreter (alias: delete)
    rvm get <version>       # upgrade rvm: stable, master

ruby installation
      fetch                   # download binary or sources for selected ruby version
      install                 # install ruby interpreter
      list                    # show currently installed ruby interpreters
      list known              # list available interpreters
      mount                   # install ruby from external locations
      patchset                # tools related to managing ruby patchsets
      pkg                     # install a dependency package
      reinstall               # reinstall ruby and run gem pristine on all gems
      remove                  # remove ruby and downloaded sources (alias: delete)
      requirements            # installs dependencies for building ruby
      uninstall               # uninstall ruby, keeping it's sources
      upgrade                 # upgrade to another ruby version, migrating gems

      do                      # runs a command against specified and/or all rubies
      gemdir                  # display path to current gem directory ($GEM_HOME)
      use <version>           # switch to given (and already installed) ruby version
      use default             # switch to default ruby, or system if none is set
      use system              # switch to system ruby
      wrapper                 # creates wrapper executables for a given ruby & gemset

-> Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language. Ruby is considered similar to Perl and Smalltalk programming languages. It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX.

-> It is fully object oriented programming language. Everything is an object in Ruby. Each and every code has their properties and actions. Here properties refer to variables and actions refer to methods.

-> Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment). It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.
